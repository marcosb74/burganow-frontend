## Introduction <a name = "introduction"></a>

This is the Front-end of a webapp called Burga N o W! This app is a burgerstore, it was developed for educational purposes in the Vue Course by Coderhouse in 2021.
The app allows users to view products, add them into the cart, register and login.

On the admin-side, the administrator can remove products, add new products, modify and delete them. Also, the administrator can view all registered users / products and grant users the administrator privilige.


## Technologies used <a name = "tech_used"></a>

**Things to remember:**

- Keep a lighthearted friendly tone. Treat the reader as someone who doesn't have a lot of knowledge about the topic but is very interested
- Keep things brief
- Use headings frequently. This breaks things up when reading and often it is good for linking to specific information
- Link to other places in the documentation often but only for additional information. Readers should not have to navigate through several pages to find information regarding one specific thing. Just inline the immediately relevant information and link off if they want to know more
- Use as many code snippets, CLI, etc. examples as possible. Show the reader what you mean
- Gently introduce a guide before diving into technical details. This gives context and readers are more likely to stay engaged longer
- It is always good to describe the functionality of the various files in your project
- Always use gender-neutral pronouns. A gender-neutral pronoun is a pronoun which does not associate a gender with the individual who is being discussed. For eg. - using 'they' instead of 'he/she'

**Things you should avoid:**

- Don't assume prior knowledge about the topic. If you want to appeal to a large audience, then you are going to have people with very diverse backgrounds
- Don't use idioms. Write using more formal terms that are well defined. This makes it easier for non-native English speakers and for translations to be written
- Don't clutter explanations with overly detailed examples
- Don't use terms that are offensive to any group. There will never be a good reason to
